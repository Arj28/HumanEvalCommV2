1. Introduction
humanevalcomm-v2-demo is a web interface that allows users to interact with the HumanevalComm V2 model. The model is designed to assess the alignment and meaningfulness between code and its accompanying comments.

2. Features
User-friendly web interface for entering code and comments
Real-time inference using the model
Runs directly in the browser with no setup needed
Clear and visual presentation of model outputs
Provides feedback or scores on codeâ€“comment alignment

3. Usage Instructions
Open the Hugging Face Space in your browser.
Enter a block of code with comments (or add new comments).
Click Submit or Evaluate.
The model will analyze the input and provide results, such as how well the comments align with the code.
Review the feedback or alignment score.

5. Installation & Dependencies
The Space is hosted on Hugging Face, but if you want to run it locally:
Requirements may include:
Python 3.8+
Libraries: transformers, torch (or tensorflow), gradio
Hugging Face Hub account (optional)

Run locally:
git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/Arj28/humanevalcomm-v2-demo
cd humanevalcomm-v2-demo
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

5. Model Details
Name: HumanevalComm V2
Goal: Evaluate the consistency and quality of comments relative to code
Input: Code with or without comments
Output: Alignment score, evaluation, or feedback on the usefulness of comments

7. Limitations & Future Work
Limitations:
May underperform with uncommon coding styles or specific domains
Sensitive to the quality and clarity of comments
Currently supports limited programming languages

Future Work:
Broader support for multiple programming languages
Advanced UI (e.g., syntax highlighting, function-level analysis)
Continuous improvements with more training data
